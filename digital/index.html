          <h1>Digital Product</h1>
          <p>
              I’ve been designing and releasing digital products for over a
              decade. For the past 5 years I’ve mentored junior designers, managed
              developers, and led research. At Morgan Stanley my designs for a new
              travel website increased surveyed user satisfaction with the
              application by 75%. On the same application we reduced the time to
              complete critical tasks by 60% and by working with developers and
              leveraging existing development assets we reduced the development
              effort by 20%. With good collaboration these are typical gains
              through the design cycle. With Dive the Data, collaborating with
              stakeholders resulted in growing sightings data to 5 regions
              globally. My designs have processed billions of dollars in
              transactions and served millions of users.

          <h1>Gather</h1>
          <p>
              It starts and ends with solid research. Typically this is where we
              discover the largest gains, for example the travel app at Morgan
              Stanley, three quarters of all users reported the same process
              complaint. Preplanning with the developers at Advisor Software
              allowed us to release a white label system with a small team in a
              record timeline of 4 months. Working with the dive centers while
              developing Dive the Data allowed us to reduce friction and increase
              enrollment in the program by triple. Research should be woven
              throughout any project. It’s an ongoing task during the product
              design cycle to guide direction and ensure you are meeting goals.
              The requirements for new design will come from this research, and
              can be informal interviews, in depth observation sessions, workshops
              with the product&#039;s users or developers, technical analysis...
              there are many options.

          We were blocked by this complex group of users for an application
          at Morgan Stanley, as the users of this application spanned several
          global regions, with a wide range of needs and unique processes tied to
          local legal requirements. This workshopping session I led ultimately
          helped us overcome this block and find a set of designs that covered all
          of the regions.

          For Enrollment123 this Market UI Analysis focused on the component
          architecture and visualizations in the competitive landscape. This led
          the design and development of the design system which modernize their
          application, ultimately processing billions in transactions.

        <div>
          <h1>Alignments</h1>
          <p>
              When I begin work with an application team I seek alignments between
              the technology that stands up the application, the business that
              drives it, and users that use it. Alignment comes from many
              directions and can be discovered through interactions, meetings,
              forms, interviews, or workshops with a diverse group of people
              orbiting the product. At Morgan Stanley finding alignments between
              the design systems team, the users of the application, and the
              application developers led to driving efficiencies in usage and
              development saving thousands of hours in employee effort. That works
              out to hundreds of thousands of dollars saved through collaboration.

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="./img/alignment.jpg" />
        <p>
          Alignment is about sharing back insights with the whole product group. This means presentations of summarys, results, user flows, context statements, etc. There are many tools but ultimatly alignment is about building relationships.

          <h1>Design</h1>
          <p>
              Producing design of the product is typically the majority of my
              engagement with clients and employers. I both lead and produce
              designs of the product. Design could take the form of presentations,
              mockups, prototypes, systems components, interface development
              specifications and guidelines. But fundamentally, design artifacts
              should guide and aid development of the product. There is no formula
              for which of these artifacts will be most useful or necessary for a
              project but my work almost always includes some interactive
              prototyping to enable pre-development testing. Static screens
              usually are in the mix as well to guide internal discussions. And
              design always includes anything necessary to guide the development
              process and reduce developer lift which typically means some kind of
              spec or systems library.

          This UI for a windows desktop game was designed in a workflow that

              It’s through working with cross functional teams that I help achieve
              cross functional results in reducing the necessary efforts of the
              product implementation. Planning with the development team can save
              a lot time in implementation. And a good design system, built as a
              developer library multiplies the savings in effort. Leveraging
              existing Design Systems reduced the development time of my
              applications at Morgan Stanley. Working within the constraints of
              existing tools allowed me to launch Dive the Data with a tiny team
              on a tiny timeline. Leading development of the design system at
              Enrollment123 streamlined modernization of their existing
              application. Development is where things get real, so anything I can
              do in my work to aid development is a win for the product.

          Components libraries help lead development effort. This one from
          the Morgan Stanley travel application MyBooking resulted in a quote from
          the development team that was 20% less then the initial pass. This is
          how good design helps save time and money.

          Developer library’s, like this one I led for the Enrollment123
          design system, help reduce developer effort which leads to more rapid
          production and ultimately a better product.

          <h1>Test</h1>
          <p>
              Testing is my forever friend. I observe the product in use. I
              analyze statistics. I test in the field. I test screens, I A/B
              funnels, I time workflows. I listen. I find frustrations. I find the
              beating heart of the product and give it blood. I heal. I find the
              successes and the joys in the product so we can enhance them. You
              can call post project research testing, or pre project testing
              research. The key is to do it often. At Piper computers I
              established relationships with nearby schools, tutoring services,
              and families bringing our software and hardware prototypes in-front
              of our users which led the design for PiperOS. At Dive the Data I
              visited centers around the world observing them in their workplace
              and leading to the design of new physical products. At Morgan
              Stanley I led workshops with users globally driving innovation
              across the many applications I developed for the firm. Always,
              always, test.
