Do what you love.
Hello

<h3>[slide: 1 O HAI]</h3>
<p>Hello excellent people of fuck up nights! My name is Dan Vallentyne.
When I was asked to speak tonight, I thought, perfect! my whole career has been a long series of fuck ups.
When I sat down to think back on my career, I remembered so many times I scewed-up I couldn’t choose between them all.
I asked myself, Which event was the most important to me and my career?</p>

<p>Would it be the time I screwed myself the hardest?</p>
<h3>[slide 2: oh fuck gif]</h3>

<p>Or the time I screwed over one of my clients?</p>
<h3>[slide: 3 i’m so fucking sorry gif]</h3>

<p>Was it a mistake I didn’t care about?</p>
<h3>[slide: 4 fuck off gif]</h3>

<p>Or was it the mistake I learned the most from?</p>
<h3>[slide:5  no fucking way gif]</h3>

<p>Looking back I realized that after every fuckup in my career, it was the decisions that followed that made the difference.</p>
<h3>[slide: 6 graphic. slowly getting better. x-axis: mistakes? timeline ending in today? a map?]</h3>
<p>No one fuck up was more important than the other, but together they formed a long string of events that eventually lead me to the work I do today.
What do I do today?</p>

<h3>[slide: 7 capslock logo]</h3>
<p>The first of which is running Capslock.
I started Capslock in the San Francisco Bay area.</p>

<h3>[slide 8: 3 products mocked up]</h3>
<p>Under this name I create digital products, I do user experience design, and I do graphic and front end development for web applications. The idea behind capslock is to create really great products</p>

<h3>[slide 9: kidconcept logo that doesn’t exist use capslock discard pile ]</h3>
<p>I also run kidconcept.com.</p>

<h3>[slide 10: kidconcept artwork ]</h3>
<p>This is primarily a space for my graphic art, illustration, and photography.</p>

<h3>[slide 11: video excerpt from plastic project]</h3>
<p>For the past two years I have also run an art project about plastic garbage.
As a diver and ocean lover, I am worried about the impact that a disposable plastic society has on the ocean environment.
Every month, I collect all of the plastic trash that I would otherwise throw away and keep it to the end of the month.
My goal is both to reduce my plastic usage and keep myself aware of how I contribute to the problem.
I have been doing this for 2 years now.</p>

<h3>[slide 12: graphic. slowly getting better. x-axis: mistakes? timeline ending in today? a map?]</h3>
<p>I love the things I do today, but I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for a lifetime of mistakes, wrong turns, and fuck ups.</p>

<h3>[slide 13: The top 3 fuck ups of my life]</h3>
<p>Estoy presentando los peores momentos de mi vida profesional. My top 3 fuck ups.</p>

<h3>[slide 14: FUCK UP LLNL, FIRED!]</h3>
<p>Numero Uno! They Say you never forget your first fuckup, and I still think back fondly on mine.
After graduating highschool I took a job working in a science laboratory in my home town.
I thought, Science seems great that’s what I should be doing.
I was fired almost immediately.
Why? I hated what I did.</p>

<h3>[slide 15: MICROSCOPE]</h3>
<p>I spent all day staring into a microscope.
OK GUYS, let me be clear. Science, is awesome! I hope many of you are or become scientists
But for me, this job, in the lab, it was super boring.
Which is why I never did any work, and why I was fired.
After I was fired I took months of introspection, drugs, and time off and I realized that I wanted to make art.
What did I learn? learned that I should do what I love! This lead me on the path of being an artist and a designer.</p>

<h3>[slide 17: FUCK UP Marketing ]</h3>
<p>Fast forward several years and I’m working for a Digital Marketing Agency in San Francisco.
I was doing digital design work just north of Silicon Valley, I thought I had really made it.
I was creating design work for major tech brands, creating advertisements and marketing materials for major social brands. But I was miserable.</p>

<h3>[slide 18: ADVERTISEMENTS EVERYWHERE]</h3>
<p>Why was I miserable? I was doing design work. Creating art commercially.
But I didn’t care about what I was making. I was creating advertisements for products I didn’t believe in, And some of my worst design work came out of this period. Why, because I was helping to make stuff in the world that I didn’t want. 40 hours a week I would create marketing and advertising for products that I didn’t think should exist. I was literally making the world worse.
What did I learn? learned that I also need to believe in my work. I mean, what I am making in the world should be valuable to me. I should be working towards something better. This lead me to create me own business, capslock.</p>

<h3>[slide 20: FUCK UP Communication]</h3>
<p>Fast forward and I’ve started Capslock, and my partner and I landed our first major client. Roman Mars and 99pi a radio show based in the bay area.</p>

<h3>[slide 21: FUCK UP VERBAL CONTRACT]</h3>
<p>I built a website that I loved for a radio show that I loved. I did the work pro bono with the promise of some promotion on the show. I thought this was first project for capslock and it would be worth having it in our portfolio. We agreed upon everything verbally because I was excited and ready to start working. We got the new site live and they loved it. We waited a long time before asking for the promised promotion and eventually they stopped responding to our emails. I did what I loved and created something great, but I didn’t get anything in return.</p>

<p>So the most obvious change from this was putting a contract into our workflow. But what really happened was that I let long periods of time pass after the work. I didn’t keep up regular communication with my client nor did I listen to them when they messaged me. This was the core of my fuckup and now I’m always ready to listen to my clients and I respond to their needs as I can.</p>

<h3>[slide 20:]</h3>

So that's just some of the many fuckups that have lead me to the work i am at now. honestly, i hope i have many more fuckups before i die. life is a lot more interesting that way.
