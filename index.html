          <h1>I design products to help future generations.</h1>
          <p>
              I design products and conduct research that will help generations to come. That’s the longview of product design. If your digital or physical product has a longview then I’m available to help with research, interface, and experience design. My experience is cross-functional and I’ve developed products and services in education, ecology, social justice, sustainable energy, finance and more throughout my career. 
              I’ve launched apps, published science, built exhibits, and communicated vision. If you need to improve adoption, engagement, functionality or reach with your product I have the skills and experience to help. I’ve mentored designers, led developers, and directed research all toward a shared vision of a better product.

          <h1>Digital Product</h1>
          <p>
              At the center of the information age is the Digital Product, and its no surprise that this type of work has dominated my career. I’ve helped produce desktop and mobile applications, web applications, software as a service, and design systems in research, insurance, finance, hospitality, education, and games.

          <h1>Physical Product</h1>
          <p>
              In a material world design often comes across the constraints of the physical. I’ve explored the world of physical design for a long time, and have designed and prototyped across a diverse space. I’ve designed textiles, games, research equipment, office equipment, food, and public sculpture.

          <p>
              My first museum installation at the Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History is at the intersection of my professional and personal interests. It’s also a return to public works design that I begin early in my career.

          <p>
              I’ve worked with the national parks in Bonaire STINAPA and the University of Queensland to publish research in the Marine Sciences. I’ve worked with the Marine Megafauna Foundation, Shark Stewards, and the Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History to communicate scientific findings on ecology, natural history, conservation and restoration to the public.

              My timeline, and how I came to be a designer focused on the Longview. From social justice communication design to Software as a service for huge corporations and on to scientific research it’s been a fun career with a lot of interesting twists. Learn how it came together for me as a product designer.
